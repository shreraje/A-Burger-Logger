## Description

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, app will display the burger's name on the left side of the page -- "Not Devoured Yet!".

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page-- "Devoured!".

* User can delete devoured burger on the right side of the page by clicking "Delete!" button on right side of the devoured burger's name

* App will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
